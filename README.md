# HollowKnight.HitCounter

HitCounter is a Hollow Knight mod which adds an in-game interface to count hits.

You have to switch manually splits with keybinds (which you can change in the in-game mod menu).

## Adding custom counters
1. Open the `Counters` folder from the mod menu or manually at path `...\hollow_knight_Data\Managed\Mods\Hit Counter\Counters`
2. Create a folder of your new counter, with the title of the counter as folder name.
3. Create a file named exactly `splits.json`, it will includes all your splits names. Ex: `["Split 1", "Split 2", "Split 3"]`
4. [Optional] You can add images for your splits. Create a folder in the counter's folder named `Images`. Then add your images in there. They have to be named the same as the splits. Ideally the resolution of the images should be square.

*Use `Any% Hitless` counter from the Counters folder as example.*
